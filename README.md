# CSC417 (Physics-based Animation) Final Project
A full python implementation of the simulation technique described by the [”Meshless Deformations Based on Shape Matching”](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-05-fall/Papers/p471-muller.pdf) paper.

Requirements:
- Python 3.7.6
- numpy
- scipy
- open3d

Please run:
- stage_1.py for a basic implementation with no extensions
- stage_2.py for linear deformation 
- stage_3.py for quadratic deformation
- stage_4.py for clustering
